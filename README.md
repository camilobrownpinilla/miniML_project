This repository contains the project repository for the final 
project for Harvard's CS 51 class, Abstraction and Design in 
Computation. 

This project is an implementation of MiniML, a subset of the 
OCaml language, in OCaml itself. It is functional and Turing complete.

See the repository description and the writeup 
[https://github.com/camilobrownpinilla/miniML_project/blob/main/writeup.pdf]
for more information.
